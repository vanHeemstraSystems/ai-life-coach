# 100 - Select an AI Interface

There is a wide choice of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Interfaces, that support the addition of references (such as documents with additional information, e.g. books).

When prompted the following in Claude, it came back with a list.

**Prompt**:

*Which Artificial Intelligence applications allow to add documents such as PDFs when prompting? Give a listing of free application, such as yourself, with links to their websites or Apple Store entries.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​*
