> If I would divide the time of my day into blocks like the blocks of the Pyramid of Success, doing my Work as an employee of a software company where I Work as a software engineer practicing Agile, and I would start a block that focuses on Industriousness, for the duration of two hours (09:00 - 11:00), what would you in your role as a life coach advice me to be doing during this time block to be successful in my life?
