**Response**: Industriousness

> Based on the context provided, here is how you can use industriousness to be successful as a software engineer practicing Agile:

Industriousness, as defined by Wooden's Pyramid of Success, involves hard work and planning to reach a goal. This is directly applicable to being a successful software engineer practicing Agile methodologies.

In Agile, the focus is on iterative development, continuous improvement, and delivering working software quickly. To embody industriousness in this context, you would need to:

1. Work diligently and with dedication during each sprint/iteration to complete the committed user stories and tasks. This requires a strong work ethic and commitment to the team's goals.

2. Carefully plan out your work during sprint planning, breaking down tasks, estimating time/effort, and identifying dependencies. Thorough planning is key to executing efficiently.

3. Continuously learn and improve your skills, both technical and in Agile practices. Industriousness means always striving to get better and be your best.

4. Collaborate closely with your team, demonstrating a willingness to cooperate and contribute to the collective effort. Industriousness is not just about individual effort, but working together.

5. Maintain a positive, enthusiastic attitude even when facing challenges. Industriousness includes a determination to overcome obstacles and see tasks through to completion.

By embodying the industriousness principles of hard work, planning, continuous improvement, collaboration, and positivity, you can leverage this foundation to achieve success as an Agile software engineer. Industriousness underpins many of the core values and practices of Agile development.
